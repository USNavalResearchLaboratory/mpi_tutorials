+MPI_Comm_remote_size
+
+   Determines the size of the remote group associated with an
+   inter-communictor
+int MPI_Comm_remote_size(
+  MPI_Comm comm,
+  int *size
+);
+
+Parameters
+
+   comm
+          [in] communicator (handle)
+
+   size
+          [out] number of processes in the remote group of comm (integer)
+
+Thread and Interrupt Safety
+
+   This routine is both thread- and interrupt-safe. This means that this
+   routine may safely be used by multiple threads and from within a signal
+   handler.
+
+Notes for Fortran
+
+   All MPI routines in Fortran (except for MPI_WTIME and MPI_WTICK) have
+   an additional argument ierr at the end of the argument list. ierr is an
+   integer and has the same meaning as the return value of the routine in
+   C. In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are invoked with the
+   call statement.
+
+   All MPI objects (e.g., MPI_Datatype, MPI_Comm) are of type INTEGER in
+   Fortran.
+
+Errors
+
+   All MPI routines (except MPI_Wtime and MPI_Wtick) return an error
+   value; C routines as the value of the function and Fortran routines in
+   the last argument. Before the value is returned, the current MPI error
+   handler is called. By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job.
+   The error handler may be changed with MPI_Comm_set_errhandler (for
+   communicators), MPI_File_set_errhandler (for files), and
+   MPI_Win_set_errhandler (for RMA windows). The MPI-1 routine
+   MPI_Errhandler_set may be used but its use is deprecated. The
+   predefined error handler MPI_ERRORS_RETURN may be used to cause error
+   values to be returned. Note that MPI does not guarentee that an MPI
+   program can continue past an error; however, MPI implementations will
+   attempt to continue whenever possible.
+
+   MPI_SUCCESS
+          No error; MPI routine completed successfully.
+
+   MPI_ERR_COMM
+          Invalid communicator. A common error is to use a null
+          communicator in a call (not even allowed in MPI_Comm_rank).
+
+   MPI_ERR_ARG
+          Invalid argument. Some argument is invalid and is not identified
+          by a specific error class (e.g., MPI_ERR_RANK).
