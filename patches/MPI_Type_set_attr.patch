+MPI_Type_set_attr
+
+   Stores attribute value associated with a key
+int MPI_Type_set_attr(
+  MPI_Datatype type,
+  int type_keyval,
+  void *attribute_val
+);
+
+Parameters
+
+   type
+          [in] MPI Datatype to which attribute will be attached (handle)
+
+   keyval
+          [in] key value, as returned by MPI_Type_create_keyval (integer)
+
+   attribute_val
+          [in] attribute value
+
+Remarks
+
+   The type of the attribute value depends on whether C or Fortran is
+   being used. In C, an attribute value is a pointer (void *); in Fortran,
+   it is an address-sized integer.
+
+   If an attribute is already present, the delete function (specified when
+   the corresponding keyval was created) will be called.
+
+Notes for Fortran
+
+   All MPI routines in Fortran (except for MPI_WTIME and MPI_WTICK) have
+   an additional argument ierr at the end of the argument list. ierr is an
+   integer and has the same meaning as the return value of the routine in
+   C. In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are invoked with the
+   call statement.
+
+   All MPI objects (e.g., MPI_Datatype, MPI_Comm) are of type INTEGER in
+   Fortran.
+
+Errors
+
+   All MPI routines (except MPI_Wtime and MPI_Wtick) return an error
+   value; C routines as the value of the function and Fortran routines in
+   the last argument. Before the value is returned, the current MPI error
+   handler is called. By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job.
+   The error handler may be changed with MPI_Comm_set_errhandler (for
+   communicators), MPI_File_set_errhandler (for files), and
+   MPI_Win_set_errhandler (for RMA windows). The MPI-1 routine
+   MPI_Errhandler_set may be used but its use is deprecated. The
+   predefined error handler MPI_ERRORS_RETURN may be used to cause error
+   values to be returned. Note that MPI does not guarentee that an MPI
+   program can continue past an error; however, MPI implementations will
+   attempt to continue whenever possible.
+
+   MPI_SUCCESS
+          No error; MPI routine completed successfully.
+
+   MPI_ERR_TYPE
+          Invalid datatype argument. May be an uncommitted MPI_Datatype
+          (see MPI_Type_commit).
+
+   MPI_ERR_KEYVAL
+          Invalid keyval
