+MPI_Scan
+
+   Computes the scan (partial reductions) of data on a collection of
+   processes
+int MPI_Scan(
+  void *sendbuf,
+  void *recvbuf,
+  int count,
+  MPI_Datatype datatype,
+  MPI_Op op,
+  MPI_Comm comm
+);
+
+Parameters
+
+   sendbuf
+          [in] starting address of send buffer (choice)
+
+   recvbuf
+          [out] starting address of receive buffer (choice)
+
+   count
+          [in] number of elements in input buffer (integer)
+
+   datatype
+          [in] data type of elements of input buffer (handle)
+
+   op
+          [in] operation (handle)
+
+   comm
+          [in] communicator (handle)
+
+Remarks
+
+   MPI_SCAN is used to perform a prefix reduction on data distributed
+   across the group. The operation returns, in the receive buffer of the
+   process with rank i, the reduction of the values in the send buffers of
+   processes with ranks 0,...,i (inclusive). The type of operations
+   supported, their semantics, and the constraints on send and receive
+   buffers are as for MPI_REDUCE.
+
+   Rationale.
+
+   We have defined an inclusive scan, that is, the prefix reduction on
+   process i includes the data from process i. An alternative is to define
+   scan in an exclusive manner, where the result on i only includes data
+   up to i-1. Both definitions are useful. The latter has some advantages:
+   the inclusive scan can always be computed from the exclusive scan with
+   no additional communication; for non-invertible operations such as max
+   and min, communication is required to compute the exclusive scan from
+   the inclusive scan. There is, however, a complication with exclusive
+   scan since one must define the "unit" element for the reduction in this
+   case. That is, one must explicitly say what occurs for process 0. This
+   was thought to be complex for user-defined operations and hence, the
+   exclusive scan was dropped.
+
+Thread and Interrupt Safety
+
+   This routine is thread-safe. This means that this routine may be safely
+   used by multiple threads without the need for any user-provided thread
+   locks. However, the routine is not interrupt safe. Typically, this is
+   due to the use of memory allocation routines such as malloc or other
+   non-MPICH runtime routines that are themselves not interrupt-safe.
+
+Notes for Fortran
+
+   All MPI routines in Fortran (except for MPI_WTIME and MPI_WTICK) have
+   an additional argument ierr at the end of the argument list. ierr is an
+   integer and has the same meaning as the return value of the routine in
+   C. In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are invoked with the
+   call statement.
+
+   All MPI objects (e.g., MPI_Datatype, MPI_Comm) are of type INTEGER in
+   Fortran.
+
+Notes on collective operations
+
+   The reduction functions (MPI_Op) do not return an error value. As a
+   result, if the functions detect an error, all they can do is either
+   call MPI_Abort or silently skip the problem. Thus, if you change the
+   error handler from MPI_ERRORS_ARE_FATAL to something else, for example,
+   MPI_ERRORS_RETURN, then no error may be indicated.
+
+   The reason for this is the performance problems in ensuring that all
+   collective routines return the same error value.
+
+Errors
+
+   All MPI routines (except MPI_Wtime and MPI_Wtick) return an error
+   value; C routines as the value of the function and Fortran routines in
+   the last argument. Before the value is returned, the current MPI error
+   handler is called. By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job.
+   The error handler may be changed with MPI_Comm_set_errhandler (for
+   communicators), MPI_File_set_errhandler (for files), and
+   MPI_Win_set_errhandler (for RMA windows). The MPI-1 routine
+   MPI_Errhandler_set may be used but its use is deprecated. The
+   predefined error handler MPI_ERRORS_RETURN may be used to cause error
+   values to be returned. Note that MPI does not guarentee that an MPI
+   program can continue past an error; however, MPI implementations will
+   attempt to continue whenever possible.
+
+   MPI_SUCCESS
+          No error; MPI routine completed successfully.
+
+   MPI_ERR_COMM
+          Invalid communicator. A common error is to use a null
+          communicator in a call (not even allowed in MPI_Comm_rank).
+
+   MPI_ERR_COUNT
+          Invalid count argument. Count arguments must be non-negative; a
+          count of zero is often valid.
+
+   MPI_ERR_TYPE
+          Invalid datatype argument. May be an uncommitted MPI_Datatype
+          (see MPI_Type_commit).
+
+   MPI_ERR_BUFFER
+          Invalid buffer pointer. Usually a null buffer where one is not
+          valid.
+
+   MPI_ERR_BUFFER
+          This error class is associcated with an error code that
+          indicates that two buffer arguments are aliased; that is, the
+          describe overlapping storage (often the exact same storage).
+          This is prohibited in MPI (because it is prohibited by the
+          Fortran standard, and rather than have a separate case for C and
+          Fortran, the MPI Forum adopted the more restrictive requirements
+          of Fortran).
