+MPI_File_create_errhandler
+
+   Create a file error handler
+int MPI_File_create_errhandler(
+  MPI_File_errhandler_fn *function,
+  MPI_Errhandler *errhandler
+);
+
+Parameters
+
+   function
+          [in] user defined error handling procedure (function)
+
+   errhandler
+          [out] MPI error handler (handle)
+
+Remarks
+
+   The user routine should be, in C, a function of type
+   MPI_File_errhandler_fn, which is defined as
+
+   typedef void MPI_File_errhandler_fn(MPI_File *, int *, ...);
+
+   The first argument is the file in use, the second is the error code to
+   be returned.
+
+   In Fortran, the user routine should be of the form:
+
+   SUBROUTINE FILE_ERRHANDLER_FN(FILE, ERROR_CODE, ... )
+   INTEGER FILE, ERROR_CODE
+
+   In C++, the user routine should be of the form:
+
+   typedef void MPI::File::Errhandler_fn(MPI::File &, int *, ... );
+
+
+Thread and Interrupt Safety
+
+   This routine is thread-safe. This means that this routine may be safely
+   used by multiple threads without the need for any user-provided thread
+   locks. However, the routine is not interrupt safe. Typically, this is
+   due to the use of memory allocation routines such as malloc or other
+   non-MPICH runtime routines that are themselves not interrupt-safe.
+
+Notes for Fortran
+
+   All MPI routines in Fortran (except for MPI_WTIME and MPI_WTICK) have
+   an additional argument ierr at the end of the argument list. ierr is an
+   integer and has the same meaning as the return value of the routine in
+   C. In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are invoked with the
+   call statement.
+
+   All MPI objects (e.g., MPI_Datatype, MPI_Comm) are of type INTEGER in
+   Fortran.
+
+Errors
+
+   All MPI routines (except MPI_Wtime and MPI_Wtick) return an error
+   value; C routines as the value of the function and Fortran routines in
+   the last argument. Before the value is returned, the current MPI error
+   handler is called. By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job.
+   The error handler may be changed with MPI_Comm_set_errhandler (for
+   communicators), MPI_File_set_errhandler (for files), and
+   MPI_Win_set_errhandler (for RMA windows). The MPI-1 routine
+   MPI_Errhandler_set may be used but its use is deprecated. The
+   predefined error handler MPI_ERRORS_RETURN may be used to cause error
+   values to be returned. Note that MPI does not guarentee that an MPI
+   program can continue past an error; however, MPI implementations will
+   attempt to continue whenever possible.
+
+   MPI_SUCCESS
+          No error; MPI routine completed successfully.
