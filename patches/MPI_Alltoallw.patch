+Parameters
+
+   sendbuf
+          [in] starting address of send buffer (choice)
+
+   sendcounts
+          [in] integer array equal to the group size specifying the number
+          of elements to send to each processor (integer)
+
+   sdispls
+          [in] integer array (of length group size). Entry j specifies the
+          displacement in bytes (relative to sendbuf) from which to take
+          the outgoing data destined for process j
+
+   sendtypes
+          [in] array of datatypes (of length group size). Entry j
+          specifies the type of data to send to process j (handle)
+
+        recvbuf
+                [out] address of receive buffer (choice)
+
+   recvcounts
+          [in] integer array equal to the group size specifying the number
+          of elements that can be received from each processor (integer)
+
+   rdispls
+          [in] integer array (of length group size). Entry i specifies the
+          displacement in bytes (relative to recvbuf) at which to place
+          the incoming data from process i
+
+   recvtypes
+          [in] array of datatypes (of length group size). Entry i
+          specifies the type of data received from process i (handle)
+
+   comm
+          [in] communicator (handle)
+
+Remarks
+
+   One of the basic data movement operations needed in parallel signal
+   processing is the 2-D matrix transpose. This operation has motivated a
+   generalization of the MPI_ALLTOALLV function. This new collective
+   operation is MPI_ALLTOALLW; the "W" indicates that it is an extension
+   to MPI_ALLTOALLV.
+
+   The following function is the most general form of All-to-all. Like
+   MPI_TYPE_CREATE_STRUCT, the most general type constructor,
+   MPI_ALLTOALLW allows separate specification of count, displacement and
+   datatype. In addition, to allow maximum flexibility, the displacement
+   of blocks within the send and receive buffers is specified in bytes.
+
+   No "in place" option is supported.
+
+   The j-th block sent from process i is received by process j and is
+   placed in the i-th block of recvbuf. These blocks need not all have the
+   same size.
+
+   The type signature associated with sendcounts[j], sendtypes[j] at
+   process i must be equal to the type signature associated with
+   recvcounts[i], recvtypes[i] at process j. This implies that the amount
+   of data sent must be equal to the amount of data received, pairwise
+   between every pair of processes. Distinct type maps between sender and
+   receiver are still allowed.
+
+   The outcome is as if each process sent a message to every other process
+   with
+
+   MPI_Send(sendbuf+sdispls[i],sendcounts[i],sendtypes[i] ,i,...),
+
+   and received a message from every other process with a call to
+
+   MPI_Recv(recvbuf+rdispls[i],recvcounts[i],recvtypes[i] ,i,...).
+
+
+   All arguments on all processes are significant. The argument comm must
+   describe the same communicator on all processes.
+
+   If comm is an intercommunicator, then the outcome is as if each process
+   in group A sends a message to each process in group B, and vice versa.
+   The j-th send buffer of process i in group A should be consistent with
+   the i-th receive buffer of process j in group B, and vice versa.
+
+   Rationale.
+
+   The MPI_ALLTOALLW function generalizes several MPI functions by
+   carefully selecting the input arguments. For example, by making all but
+   one process have sendcounts[i] = 0, this achieves an MPI_SCATTERW
+   function.
+
+Thread and Interrupt Safety
+
+   This routine is thread-safe. This means that this routine may be safely
+   used by multiple threads without the need for any user-provided thread
+   locks. However, the routine is not interrupt safe. Typically, this is
+   due to the use of memory allocation routines such as malloc or other
+   non-MPICH runtime routines that are themselves not interrupt-safe.
+
+Notes for Fortran
+
+   All MPI routines in Fortran (except for MPI_WTIME and MPI_WTICK) have
+   an additional argument ierr at the end of the argument list. ierr is an
+   integer and has the same meaning as the return value of the routine in
+   C. In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are invoked with the
+   call statement.
+
+   All MPI objects (e.g., MPI_Datatype, MPI_Comm) are of type INTEGER in
+   Fortran.
+
+Errors
+
+   All MPI routines (except MPI_Wtime and MPI_Wtick) return an error
+   value; C routines as the value of the function and Fortran routines in
+   the last argument. Before the value is returned, the current MPI error
+   handler is called. By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job.
+   The error handler may be changed with MPI_Comm_set_errhandler (for
+   communicators), MPI_File_set_errhandler (for files), and
+   MPI_Win_set_errhandler (for RMA windows). The MPI-1 routine
+   MPI_Errhandler_set may be used but its use is deprecated. The
+   predefined error handler MPI_ERRORS_RETURN may be used to cause error
+   values to be returned. Note that MPI does not guarentee that an MPI
+   program can continue past an error; however, MPI implementations will
+   attempt to continue whenever possible.
+
+   MPI_SUCCESS
+          No error; MPI routine completed successfully.
+
+   MPI_ERR_COMM
+          Invalid communicator. A common error is to use a null
+          communicator in a call (not even allowed in MPI_Comm_rank).
+
+   MPI_ERR_ARG
+          Invalid argument. Some argument is invalid and is not identified
+          by a specific error class (e.g., MPI_ERR_RANK).
+
+   MPI_ERR_COUNT
+          Invalid count argument. Count arguments must be non-negative; a
+          count of zero is often valid.
+
+   MPI_ERR_TYPE
+          Invalid datatype argument. May be an uncommitted MPI_Datatype
+          (see MPI_Type_commit).
