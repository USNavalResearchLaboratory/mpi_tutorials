+MPI_Comm_set_errhandler
+
+   Set the error handler for a communicator
+int MPI_Comm_set_errhandler(
+  MPI_Comm comm,
+  MPI_Errhandler errhandler
+);
+
+Parameters
+
+   comm
+          [in] communicator (handle)
+
+   errhandler
+          [in] new error handler for communicator (handle)
+
+Remarks
+
+   Attaches a new error handler to a communicator. The error handler must
+   be either a predefined error handler (MPI_ERRORS_RETURN,
+   MPI_ERRORS_ARE_FATAL), or an error handler created by a call to
+   MPI_COMM_CREATE_ERRHANDLER. This call is identical to
+   MPI_ERRHANDLER_SET, whose use is deprecated.
+
+Thread and Interrupt Safety
+
+   This routine is thread and interrupt safe only if no MPI routine that
+   updates or frees the same MPI object may be called concurrently with
+   this routine.
+
+   The MPI standard defined a thread-safe interface but this does not mean
+   that all routines may be called without any thread locks. For example,
+   two threads must not attempt to change the contents of the same
+   MPI_Info object concurrently. The user is responsible in this case for
+   using some mechanism, such as thread locks, to ensure that only one
+   thread at a time makes use of this routine.
+
+Notes for Fortran
+
+   All MPI routines in Fortran (except for MPI_WTIME and MPI_WTICK) have
+   an additional argument ierr at the end of the argument list. ierr is an
+   integer and has the same meaning as the return value of the routine in
+   C. In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are invoked with the
+   call statement.
+
+   All MPI objects (e.g., MPI_Datatype, MPI_Comm) are of type INTEGER in
+   Fortran.
+
+Errors
+
+   All MPI routines (except MPI_Wtime and MPI_Wtick) return an error
+   value; C routines as the value of the function and Fortran routines in
+   the last argument. Before the value is returned, the current MPI error
+   handler is called. By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job.
+   The error handler may be changed with MPI_Comm_set_errhandler (for
+   communicators), MPI_File_set_errhandler (for files), and
+   MPI_Win_set_errhandler (for RMA windows). The MPI-1 routine
+   MPI_Errhandler_set may be used but its use is deprecated. The
+   predefined error handler MPI_ERRORS_RETURN may be used to cause error
+   values to be returned. Note that MPI does not guarentee that an MPI
+   program can continue past an error; however, MPI implementations will
+   attempt to continue whenever possible.
+
+   MPI_SUCCESS
+          No error; MPI routine completed successfully.
+
+   MPI_ERR_COMM
+          Invalid communicator. A common error is to use a null
+          communicator in a call (not even allowed in MPI_Comm_rank).
+
+   MPI_ERR_OTHER
+          Other error; use MPI_Error_string to get more information about
+          this error code.
