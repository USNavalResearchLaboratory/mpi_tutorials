+MPI_Group_range_incl
+
+   Creates a new group from ranges of ranks in an existing group
+int MPI_Group_range_incl(
+  MPI_Group group,
+  int n,
+  int ranges[][3],
+  MPI_Group *newgroup
+);
+
+Parameters
+
+   group
+          [in] group (handle)
+
+   n
+          [in] number of triplets in array ranges (integer)
+
+   ranges
+          [in] a one-dimensional array of integer triplets, of the form
+          (first rank, last rank, stride) indicating ranks in group or
+          processes to be included in newgroup.
+
+   newgroup
+          [out] new group derived from above, in the order defined by
+          ranges (handle)
+
+Remarks
+
+   If ranges consist of the triplets
+
+   [img144.gif]
+
+   then newgroup consists of the sequence of processes in group with ranks
+
+   [img145.gif]
+
+
+   [img146.gif]
+
+   Each computed rank must be a valid rank in group and all computed ranks
+   must be distinct, or else the program is erroneous. Note that we may
+   have first[i] > last[i], and stride[i] may be negative, but cannot be
+   zero.
+
+   The functionality of this routine is specified to be equivalent to
+   expanding the array of ranges to an array of the included ranks and
+   passing the resulting array of ranks and other arguments to
+   MPI_GROUP_INCL. A call to MPI_GROUP_INCL is equivalent to a call to
+   MPI_GROUP_RANGE_INCL with each rank i in ranks replaced by the triplet
+   (i,i,1) in the argument ranges.
+
+Thread and Interrupt Safety
+
+   This routine is thread-safe. This means that this routine may be safely
+   used by multiple threads without the need for any user-provided thread
+   locks. However, the routine is not interrupt safe. Typically, this is
+   due to the use of memory allocation routines such as malloc or other
+   non-MPICH runtime routines that are themselves not interrupt-safe.
+
+Notes for Fortran
+
+   All MPI routines in Fortran (except for MPI_WTIME and MPI_WTICK) have
+   an additional argument ierr at the end of the argument list. ierr is an
+   integer and has the same meaning as the return value of the routine in
+   C. In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are invoked with the
+   call statement.
+
+   All MPI objects (e.g., MPI_Datatype, MPI_Comm) are of type INTEGER in
+   Fortran.
+
+Errors
+
+   All MPI routines (except MPI_Wtime and MPI_Wtick) return an error
+   value; C routines as the value of the function and Fortran routines in
+   the last argument. Before the value is returned, the current MPI error
+   handler is called. By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job.
+   The error handler may be changed with MPI_Comm_set_errhandler (for
+   communicators), MPI_File_set_errhandler (for files), and
+   MPI_Win_set_errhandler (for RMA windows). The MPI-1 routine
+   MPI_Errhandler_set may be used but its use is deprecated. The
+   predefined error handler MPI_ERRORS_RETURN may be used to cause error
+   values to be returned. Note that MPI does not guarentee that an MPI
+   program can continue past an error; however, MPI implementations will
+   attempt to continue whenever possible.
+
+   MPI_SUCCESS
+          No error; MPI routine completed successfully.
+
+   MPI_ERR_GROUP
+          Null or invalid group passed to function.
+
+   MPI_ERR_INTERN
+          This error is returned when some part of the MPICH
+          implementation is unable to acquire memory.
+
+   MPI_ERR_ARG
+          Invalid argument. Some argument is invalid and is not identified
+          by a specific error class (e.g., MPI_ERR_RANK).
+
+   MPI_ERR_RANK
+          Invalid source or destination rank. Ranks must be between zero
+          and the size of the communicator minus one; ranks in a receive
+          (MPI_Recv, MPI_Irecv, MPI_Sendrecv, etc.) may also be
+          MPI_ANY_SOURCE.
