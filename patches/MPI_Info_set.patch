+MPI_Info_set
+
+   Adds a (key,value) pair to info
+int MPI_Info_set(
+  MPI_Info info,
+  char *key,
+  char *value
+);
+
+int MPI_Info_set(
+  MPI_Info info,
+  wchar_t *key,
+  wchar_t *value
+);
+
+Parameters
+
+   info
+          [in] info object (handle)
+
+   key
+          [in] key (string)
+
+   value
+          [in] value (string)
+
+Remarks
+
+   MPI_INFO_SET adds the (key,value) pair to info, and overrides the value
+   if a value for the same key was previously set. key and value are
+   null-terminated strings in C. In Fortran, leading and trailing spaces
+   in key and value are stripped. If either key or value are larger than
+   the allowed maximums, the errors MPI_ERR_INFO_KEY or MPI_ERR_INFO_VALUE
+   are raised, respectively.
+
+Thread and Interrupt Safety
+
+   The user is responsible for ensuring that multiple threads do not try
+   to update the same MPI object from different threads. This routine
+   should not be used from within a signal handler.
+
+   The MPI standard defined a thread-safe interface but this does not mean
+   that all routines may be called without any thread locks. For example,
+   two threads must not attempt to change the contents of the same
+   MPI_Info object concurrently. The user is responsible in this case for
+   using some mechanism, such as thread locks, to ensure that only one
+   thread at a time makes use of this routine.
+
+Notes for Fortran
+
+   All MPI routines in Fortran (except for MPI_WTIME and MPI_WTICK) have
+   an additional argument ierr at the end of the argument list. ierr is an
+   integer and has the same meaning as the return value of the routine in
+   C. In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are invoked with the
+   call statement.
+
+   All MPI objects (e.g., MPI_Datatype, MPI_Comm) are of type INTEGER in
+   Fortran.
+
+Errors
+
+   All MPI routines (except MPI_Wtime and MPI_Wtick) return an error
+   value; C routines as the value of the function and Fortran routines in
+   the last argument. Before the value is returned, the current MPI error
+   handler is called. By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job.
+   The error handler may be changed with MPI_Comm_set_errhandler (for
+   communicators), MPI_File_set_errhandler (for files), and
+   MPI_Win_set_errhandler (for RMA windows). The MPI-1 routine
+   MPI_Errhandler_set may be used but its use is deprecated. The
+   predefined error handler MPI_ERRORS_RETURN may be used to cause error
+   values to be returned. Note that MPI does not guarentee that an MPI
+   program can continue past an error; however, MPI implementations will
+   attempt to continue whenever possible.
+
+   MPI_SUCCESS
+          No error; MPI routine completed successfully.
+
+   MPI_ERR_INFO_KEY
+          Invalid or null key string for info.
+
+   MPI_ERR_INFO_VALUE
+          Invalid or null value string for info
+
+   MPI_ERR_INTERN
+          This error is returned when some part of the MPICH
+          implementation is unable to acquire memory.
