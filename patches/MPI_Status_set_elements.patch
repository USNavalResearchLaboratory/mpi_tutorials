+MPI_Status_set_elements
+
+   Set the number of elements in a status
+int MPI_Status_set_elements(
+  MPI_Status *status,
+  MPI_Datatype datatype,
+  int count
+);
+
+Parameters
+
+   status
+          [in] status to associate count with (Status)
+
+   datatype
+          [in] datatype associated with count (handle)
+
+   count
+          [in] number of elements to associate with status (integer)
+
+Remarks
+
+   This call modifies the opaque part of status so that a call to
+   MPI_GET_ELEMENTS will return count. MPI_GET_COUNT will return a
+   compatible value.
+
+   Rationale.
+
+   The number of elements is set instead of the count because the former
+   can deal with nonintegral number of datatypes. ( End of rationale.)
+
+   A subsequent call to MPI_GET_COUNT(status, datatype, count) or to
+   MPI_GET_ELEMENTS(status, datatype, count) must use a datatype argument
+   that has the same type signature as the datatype argument that was used
+   in the call to MPI_STATUS_SET_ELEMENTS.
+
+   Rationale.
+
+   This is similar to the restriction that holds when when count is set by
+   a receive operation: in that case, the calls to MPI_GET_COUNT and
+   MPI_GET_ELEMENTS must use a datatype with the same signature as the
+   datatype used in the receive call.
+
+Thread and Interrupt Safety
+
+   This routine is thread-safe. This means that this routine may be safely
+   used by multiple threads without the need for any user-provided thread
+   locks. However, the routine is not interrupt safe. Typically, this is
+   due to the use of memory allocation routines such as malloc or other
+   non-MPICH runtime routines that are themselves not interrupt-safe.
+
+Notes for Fortran
+
+   All MPI routines in Fortran (except for MPI_WTIME and MPI_WTICK) have
+   an additional argument ierr at the end of the argument list. ierr is an
+   integer and has the same meaning as the return value of the routine in
+   C. In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are invoked with the
+   call statement.
+
+   All MPI objects (e.g., MPI_Datatype, MPI_Comm) are of type INTEGER in
+   Fortran.
+
+Errors
+
+   All MPI routines (except MPI_Wtime and MPI_Wtick) return an error
+   value; C routines as the value of the function and Fortran routines in
+   the last argument. Before the value is returned, the current MPI error
+   handler is called. By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job.
+   The error handler may be changed with MPI_Comm_set_errhandler (for
+   communicators), MPI_File_set_errhandler (for files), and
+   MPI_Win_set_errhandler (for RMA windows). The MPI-1 routine
+   MPI_Errhandler_set may be used but its use is deprecated. The
+   predefined error handler MPI_ERRORS_RETURN may be used to cause error
+   values to be returned. Note that MPI does not guarentee that an MPI
+   program can continue past an error; however, MPI implementations will
+   attempt to continue whenever possible.
+
+   MPI_SUCCESS
+          No error; MPI routine completed successfully.
+
+   MPI_ERR_ARG
+          Invalid argument. Some argument is invalid and is not identified
+          by a specific error class (e.g., MPI_ERR_RANK).
+
+   MPI_ERR_TYPE
+          Invalid datatype argument. May be an uncommitted MPI_Datatype
+          (see MPI_Type_commit).
