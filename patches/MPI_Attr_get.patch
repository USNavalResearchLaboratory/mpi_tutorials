+MPI_Attr_get
+
+   Retrieves attribute value by key
+int MPI_Attr_get(
+  MPI_Comm comm,
+  int keyval,
+  void *attr_value,
+  int *flag
+);
+
+Parameters
+
+   comm
+          [in] communicator to which attribute is attached (handle)
+
+   keyval
+          [in] key value (integer)
+
+   attr_value
+          [out] attribute value, unless flag = false
+
+   flag
+          [out] true if an attribute value was extracted; false if no
+          attribute is associated with the key
+
+Remarks
+
+   Retrieves attribute value by key. The call is erroneous if there is no
+   key with value keyval. On the other hand, the call is correct if the
+   key value exists, but no attribute is attached on comm for that key; in
+   such case, the call returns flag = false. In particular
+   MPI_KEYVAL_INVALID is an erroneous key value.
+
+   Advice to users.
+
+   The call to MPI_Attr_put passes in attribute_val the value of the
+   attribute; the call to MPI_Attr_get passes in attribute_val the address
+   of the the location where the attribute value is to be returned. Thus,
+   if the attribute value itself is a pointer of type void*, the the
+   actual attribute_val parameter to MPI_Attr_put will be of type void*
+   and the actual attribute_val parameter to MPI_Attr_put will be of type
+   void**.
+   Attributes must be extracted from the same language as they were
+   inserted in with MPI_ATTR_PUT. The notes for C and Fortran below
+   explain why.
+
+Notes for C
+
+   Even though the attr_value arguement is declared as void *, it is
+   really the address of a void pointer (i.e., a void **). Using a void *,
+   however, is more in keeping with C idiom and allows the pointer to be
+   passed without additional casts.
+
+Thread and Interrupt Safety
+
+   This routine is thread-safe. This means that this routine may be safely
+   used by multiple threads without the need for any user-provided thread
+   locks. However, the routine is not interrupt safe. Typically, this is
+   due to the use of memory allocation routines such as malloc or other
+   non-MPICH runtime routines that are themselves not interrupt-safe.
+
+Deprecated Function
+
+   The MPI-2 standard deprecated a number of routines because MPI-2
+   provides better versions. This routine is one of those that was
+   deprecated. The routine may continue to be used, but new code should
+   use the replacement routine. The replacement for this routine is
+   MPI_Comm_get_attr.
+
+Notes for Fortran
+
+   All MPI routines in Fortran (except for MPI_WTIME and MPI_WTICK) have
+   an additional argument ierr at the end of the argument list. ierr is an
+   integer and has the same meaning as the return value of the routine in
+   C. In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are invoked with the
+   call statement.
+
+   All MPI objects (e.g., MPI_Datatype, MPI_Comm) are of type INTEGER in
+   Fortran.
+
+   The attr_value in Fortran is a pointer to a Fortran integer, not a
+   pointer to a void *.
+
+Errors
+
+   All MPI routines (except MPI_Wtime and MPI_Wtick) return an error
+   value; C routines as the value of the function and Fortran routines in
+   the last argument. Before the value is returned, the current MPI error
+   handler is called. By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job.
+   The error handler may be changed with MPI_Comm_set_errhandler (for
+   communicators), MPI_File_set_errhandler (for files), and
+   MPI_Win_set_errhandler (for RMA windows). The MPI-1 routine
+   MPI_Errhandler_set may be used but its use is deprecated. The
+   predefined error handler MPI_ERRORS_RETURN may be used to cause error
+   values to be returned. Note that MPI does not guarentee that an MPI
+   program can continue past an error; however, MPI implementations will
+   attempt to continue whenever possible.
+
+   MPI_SUCCESS
+          No error; MPI routine completed successfully.
+
+   MPI_ERR_COMM
+          Invalid communicator. A common error is to use a null
+          communicator in a call (not even allowed in MPI_Comm_rank).
+
+   MPI_ERR_KEYVAL
+          Invalid keyval
