+
+Parameters
+
+   type
+          [in] datatype whose name is to be returned (handle)
+
+   type_name
+          [out] the name previously stored on the datatype, or a empty
+          string if no such name exists (string)
+
+   resultlen
+          [out] length of returned name (integer)
+
+Remarks
+
+   MPI_COMM_GET_NAME returns the last name which has previously been
+   associated with the given communicator. The name may be set and got
+   from any language. The same name will be returned independent of the
+   language used. name should be allocated so that it can hold a resulting
+   string of length MPI_MAX_OBJECT_NAME characters. MPI_COMM_GET_NAME
+   returns a copy of the set name in name.
+
+   If the user has not associated a name with a communicator, or an error
+   occurs, MPI_COMM_GET_NAME will return an empty string (all spaces in
+   Fortran, "" in C and C++). The three predefined communicators will have
+   predefined names associated with them. Thus, the names of
+   MPI_COMM_WORLD, MPI_COMM_SELF, and MPI_COMM_PARENT will have the
+   default of MPI_COMM_WORLD, MPI_COMM_SELF, and MPI_COMM_PARENT. The fact
+   that the system may have chosen to give a default name to a
+   communicator does not prevent the user from setting a name on the same
+   communicator; doing this removes the old name and assigns the new one.
+
+   Rationale.
+
+   We provide separate functions for setting and getting the name of a
+   communicator, rather than simply providing a predefined attribute key
+   for the following reasons:
+     * It is not, in general, possible to store a string as an attribute
+       from Fortran.
+
+     * It is not easy to set up the delete function for a string attribute
+       unless it is known to have been allocated from the heap.
+
+     * To make the attribute key useful additional code to call strdup is
+       necessary. If this is not standardized then users have to write it.
+       This is extra unneeded work which we can easily eliminate.
+
+     * The Fortran binding is not trivial to write (it will depend on
+       details of the Fortran compilation system), and will not be
+       portable. Therefore it should be in the library rather than in user
+       code.
+
+   ( End of rationale.)
+   Advice to users.
+
+   The above definition means that it is safe simply to print the string
+   returned by MPI_COMM_GET_NAME, as it is always a valid string even if
+   there was no name.
+
+   Note that associating a name with a communicator has no effect on the
+   semantics of an MPI program, and will (necessarily) increase the store
+   requirement of the program, since the names must be saved. Therefore
+   there is no requirement that users use these functions to associate
+   names with communicators. However debugging and profiling MPI
+   applications may be made easier if names are associated with
+   communicators, since the debugger or profiler should then be able to
+   present information in a less cryptic manner.
+
+Thread and Interrupt Safety
+
+   This routine is thread and interrupt safe only if no MPI routine that
+   updates or frees the same MPI object may be called concurrently with
+   this routine.
+
+   The MPI standard defined a thread-safe interface but this does not mean
+   that all routines may be called without any thread locks. For example,
+   two threads must not attempt to change the contents of the same
+   MPI_Info object concurrently. The user is responsible in this case for
+   using some mechanism, such as thread locks, to ensure that only one
+   thread at a time makes use of this routine.
+
+   Null Handles The MPI 1.1 specification, in the section on opaque
+   objects, explicitly disallows freeing a null communicator. The text
+   from the standard is:
+ A null handle argument is an erroneous IN argument in MPI calls, unless an
+ exception is explicitly stated in the text that defines the function. Such
+ exception is allowed for handles to request objects in Wait and Test calls
+ (sections Communication Completion and Multiple Completions ). Otherwise, a
+ null handle can only be passed to a function that allocates a new object and
+ returns a reference to it in the handle.
+
+Notes for Fortran
+
+   All MPI routines in Fortran (except for MPI_WTIME and MPI_WTICK) have
+   an additional argument ierr at the end of the argument list. ierr is an
+   integer and has the same meaning as the return value of the routine in
+   C. In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are invoked with the
+   call statement.
+
+   All MPI objects (e.g., MPI_Datatype, MPI_Comm) are of type INTEGER in
+   Fortran.
+
+Errors
+
+   All MPI routines (except MPI_Wtime and MPI_Wtick) return an error
+   value; C routines as the value of the function and Fortran routines in
+   the last argument. Before the value is returned, the current MPI error
+   handler is called. By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job.
+   The error handler may be changed with MPI_Comm_set_errhandler (for
+   communicators), MPI_File_set_errhandler (for files), and
+   MPI_Win_set_errhandler (for RMA windows). The MPI-1 routine
+   MPI_Errhandler_set may be used but its use is deprecated. The
+   predefined error handler MPI_ERRORS_RETURN may be used to cause error
+   values to be returned. Note that MPI does not guarentee that an MPI
+   program can continue past an error; however, MPI implementations will
+   attempt to continue whenever possible.
+
+   MPI_SUCCESS
+          No error; MPI routine completed successfully.
+
+   MPI_ERR_TYPE
+          Invalid datatype argument. May be an uncommitted MPI_Datatype
+          (see MPI_Type_commit).
+
+   MPI_ERR_ARG
+          Invalid argument. Some argument is invalid and is not identified
+          by a specific error class (e.g., MPI_ERR_RANK).
