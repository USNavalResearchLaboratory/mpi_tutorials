+MPI_Type_create_hindexed
+
+   Create a datatype for an indexed datatype with displacements in bytes
+int MPI_Type_create_hindexed(
+  int count,
+  int blocklengths[],
+  MPI_Aint displacements[],
+  MPI_Datatype oldtype,
+  MPI_Datatype *newtype
+);
+
+Parameters
+
+   count
+          [in] number of blocks --- also number of entries in
+          displacements and blocklengths (integer)
+
+   blocklengths
+          [in] number of elements in each block (array of nonnegative
+          integers)
+
+   displacements
+          [in] byte displacement of each block (array of integer)
+
+   oldtype
+          [in] old datatype (handle)
+
+   newtype
+          [out] new datatype (handle)
+
+Remarks
+
+   The function MPI_TYPE_CREATE_HINDEXED is identical to
+   MPI_TYPE_CREATE_INDEXED, except that block displacements in
+   array_of_displacements are specified in bytes, rather than in multiples
+   of the oldtype extent.
+
+   Assume that oldtype has type map,
+
+   [img61.gif]
+
+   with extent ex. Let B be the array_of_blocklength argument and D be the
+   array_of_displacements argument. The newly created datatype has a type
+   map with [img62.gif] entries:

+Thread and Interrupt Safety
+
+   This routine is thread-safe. This means that this routine may be safely
+   used by multiple threads without the need for any user-provided thread
+   locks. However, the routine is not interrupt safe. Typically, this is
+   due to the use of memory allocation routines such as malloc or other
+   non-MPICH runtime routines that are themselves not interrupt-safe.
+
+Notes for Fortran
+
+   All MPI routines in Fortran (except for MPI_WTIME and MPI_WTICK) have
+   an additional argument ierr at the end of the argument list. ierr is an
+   integer and has the same meaning as the return value of the routine in
+   C. In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are invoked with the
+   call statement.
+
+   All MPI objects (e.g., MPI_Datatype, MPI_Comm) are of type INTEGER in
+   Fortran.
+
+Errors
+
+   All MPI routines (except MPI_Wtime and MPI_Wtick) return an error
+   value; C routines as the value of the function and Fortran routines in
+   the last argument. Before the value is returned, the current MPI error
+   handler is called. By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job.
+   The error handler may be changed with MPI_Comm_set_errhandler (for
+   communicators), MPI_File_set_errhandler (for files), and
+   MPI_Win_set_errhandler (for RMA windows). The MPI-1 routine
+   MPI_Errhandler_set may be used but its use is deprecated. The
+   predefined error handler MPI_ERRORS_RETURN may be used to cause error
+   values to be returned. Note that MPI does not guarentee that an MPI
+   program can continue past an error; however, MPI implementations will
+   attempt to continue whenever possible.
+
+   MPI_SUCCESS
+          No error; MPI routine completed successfully.
+
+   MPI_ERR_TYPE
+          Invalid datatype argument. May be an uncommitted MPI_Datatype
+          (see MPI_Type_commit).
+
+   MPI_ERR_ARG
+          Invalid argument. Some argument is invalid and is not identified
+          by a specific error class (e.g., MPI_ERR_RANK).
