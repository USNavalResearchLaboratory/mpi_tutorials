+MPI_Group_incl
+
+   Produces a group by reordering an existing group and taking only listed
+   members
+int MPI_Group_incl(
+  MPI_Group group,
+  int n,
+  int *ranks,
+  MPI_Group *newgroup
+);
+
+Parameters
+
+   group
+          [in] group (handle)
+
+   n
+          [in] number of elements in array ranks (and size of newgroup )
+          (integer)
+
+   ranks
+          [in] ranks of processes in group to appear in newgroup (array of
+          integers)
+
+   newgroup
+          [out] new group derived from above, in the order defined by
+          ranks (handle)
+
+Remarks
+
+   The function MPI_GROUP_INCL creates a group newgroup that consists of
+   the n processes in group with ranks rank[0], [img142.gif] , rank[n-1];
+   the process with rank i in newgroup is the process with rank ranks[i]
+   in group. Each of the n elements of ranks must be a valid rank in group
+   and all elements must be distinct, or else the program is erroneous. If
+   n~=~0, then newgroup is MPI_GROUP_EMPTY. This function can, for
+   instance, be used to reorder the elements of a group.
+
+Thread and Interrupt Safety
+
+   This routine is thread-safe. This means that this routine may be safely
+   used by multiple threads without the need for any user-provided thread
+   locks. However, the routine is not interrupt safe. Typically, this is
+   due to the use of memory allocation routines such as malloc or other
+   non-MPICH runtime routines that are themselves not interrupt-safe.
+
+Notes for Fortran
+
+   All MPI routines in Fortran (except for MPI_WTIME and MPI_WTICK) have
+   an additional argument ierr at the end of the argument list. ierr is an
+   integer and has the same meaning as the return value of the routine in
+   C. In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are invoked with the
+   call statement.
+
+   All MPI objects (e.g., MPI_Datatype, MPI_Comm) are of type INTEGER in
+   Fortran.
+
+Errors
+
+   All MPI routines (except MPI_Wtime and MPI_Wtick) return an error
+   value; C routines as the value of the function and Fortran routines in
+   the last argument. Before the value is returned, the current MPI error
+   handler is called. By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job.
+   The error handler may be changed with MPI_Comm_set_errhandler (for
+   communicators), MPI_File_set_errhandler (for files), and
+   MPI_Win_set_errhandler (for RMA windows). The MPI-1 routine
+   MPI_Errhandler_set may be used but its use is deprecated. The
+   predefined error handler MPI_ERRORS_RETURN may be used to cause error
+   values to be returned. Note that MPI does not guarentee that an MPI
+   program can continue past an error; however, MPI implementations will
+   attempt to continue whenever possible.
+
+   MPI_SUCCESS
+          No error; MPI routine completed successfully.
+
+   MPI_ERR_GROUP
+          Null or invalid group passed to function.
+
+   MPI_ERR_ARG
+          Invalid argument. Some argument is invalid and is not identified
+          by a specific error class (e.g., MPI_ERR_RANK).
+
+   MPI_ERR_INTERN
+          This error is returned when some part of the MPICH
+          implementation is unable to acquire memory.
+
+   MPI_ERR_RANK
+          Invalid source or destination rank. Ranks must be between zero
+          and the size of the communicator minus one; ranks in a receive
+          (MPI_Recv, MPI_Irecv, MPI_Sendrecv, etc.) may also be
+          MPI_ANY_SOURCE.
