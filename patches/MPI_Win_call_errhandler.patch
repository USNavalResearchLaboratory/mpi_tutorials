+MPI_Win_call_errhandler
+
+   Call the error handler installed on a window object
+int MPI_Win_call_errhandler(
+  MPI_Win win,
+  int errorcode
+);
+
+Parameters
+
+   win
+          [in] window with error handler (handle)
+
+   errorcode
+          [in] error code (integer)
+
+Remarks
+
+   This function invokes the error handler assigned to the window with the
+   error code supplied. This function returns MPI_SUCCESS in C and C++ and
+   the same value in IERROR if the error handler was successfully called
+   (assuming the process is not aborted and the error handler returns).
+
+   Assuming the input parameters are valid, when the error handler is set
+   to MPI_ERRORS_RETURN, this routine will always return MPI_SUCCESS.
+
+   Advice to users.
+
+   As with communicators, the default error handler for windows is
+   MPI_ERRORS_ARE_FATAL.
+
+Thread and Interrupt Safety
+
+   This routine is thread and interrupt safe only if no MPI routine that
+   updates or frees the same MPI object may be called concurrently with
+   this routine.
+
+   The MPI standard defined a thread-safe interface but this does not mean
+   that all routines may be called without any thread locks. For example,
+   two threads must not attempt to change the contents of the same
+   MPI_Info object concurrently. The user is responsible in this case for
+   using some mechanism, such as thread locks, to ensure that only one
+   thread at a time makes use of this routine.
+
+Notes for Fortran
+
+   All MPI routines in Fortran (except for MPI_WTIME and MPI_WTICK) have
+   an additional argument ierr at the end of the argument list. ierr is an
+   integer and has the same meaning as the return value of the routine in
+   C. In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are invoked with the
+   call statement.
+
+   All MPI objects (e.g., MPI_Datatype, MPI_Comm) are of type INTEGER in
+   Fortran.
+
+Errors
+
+   All MPI routines (except MPI_Wtime and MPI_Wtick) return an error
+   value; C routines as the value of the function and Fortran routines in
+   the last argument. Before the value is returned, the current MPI error
+   handler is called. By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job.
+   The error handler may be changed with MPI_Comm_set_errhandler (for
+   communicators), MPI_File_set_errhandler (for files), and
+   MPI_Win_set_errhandler (for RMA windows). The MPI-1 routine
+   MPI_Errhandler_set may be used but its use is deprecated. The
+   predefined error handler MPI_ERRORS_RETURN may be used to cause error
+   values to be returned. Note that MPI does not guarentee that an MPI
+   program can continue past an error; however, MPI implementations will
+   attempt to continue whenever possible.
+
+   MPI_SUCCESS
+          No error; MPI routine completed successfully.
+
+   MPI_ERR_WIN
+          Invalid MPI window object
