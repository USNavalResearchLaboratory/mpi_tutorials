+MPI_Type_ub
+
+   Returns the upper bound of a datatype
+int MPI_Type_ub(
+  MPI_Datatype datatype,
+  MPI_Aint *displacement
+);
+
+Parameters
+
+   datatype
+          [in] datatype (handle)
+
+   displacement
+          [out] displacement of upper bound from origin, in bytes
+          (integer)
+
+Deprecated Function
+
+   The MPI-2 standard deprecated a number of routines because MPI-2
+   provides better versions. This routine is one of those that was
+   deprecated. The routine may continue to be used, but new code should
+   use the replacement routine. The replacement for this routine is
+   MPI_Type_get_extent
+
+Thread and Interrupt Safety
+
+   This routine is both thread- and interrupt-safe. This means that this
+   routine may safely be used by multiple threads and from within a signal
+   handler.
+
+Notes for Fortran
+
+   All MPI routines in Fortran (except for MPI_WTIME and MPI_WTICK) have
+   an additional argument ierr at the end of the argument list. ierr is an
+   integer and has the same meaning as the return value of the routine in
+   C. In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are invoked with the
+   call statement.
+
+   All MPI objects (e.g., MPI_Datatype, MPI_Comm) are of type INTEGER in
+   Fortran.
+
+Errors
+
+   All MPI routines (except MPI_Wtime and MPI_Wtick) return an error
+   value; C routines as the value of the function and Fortran routines in
+   the last argument. Before the value is returned, the current MPI error
+   handler is called. By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job.
+   The error handler may be changed with MPI_Comm_set_errhandler (for
+   communicators), MPI_File_set_errhandler (for files), and
+   MPI_Win_set_errhandler (for RMA windows). The MPI-1 routine
+   MPI_Errhandler_set may be used but its use is deprecated. The
+   predefined error handler MPI_ERRORS_RETURN may be used to cause error
+   values to be returned. Note that MPI does not guarentee that an MPI
+   program can continue past an error; however, MPI implementations will
+   attempt to continue whenever possible.
+
+   MPI_SUCCESS
+          No error; MPI routine completed successfully.
+
+   MPI_ERR_TYPE
+          Invalid datatype argument. May be an uncommitted MPI_Datatype
+          (see MPI_Type_commit).
+
+   MPI_ERR_ARG
+          Invalid argument. Some argument is invalid and is not identified
+          by a specific error class (e.g., MPI_ERR_RANK).
