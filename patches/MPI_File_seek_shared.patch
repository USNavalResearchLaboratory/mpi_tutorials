+MPI_File_seek_shared
+
+   Updates the shared file pointer
+int MPI_File_seek_shared(
+  MPI_File mpi_fh,
+  MPI_Offset offset,
+  int whence
+);
+
+Parameters
+
+   mpi_fh
+          [in] file handle (handle)
+
+   offset
+          [in] file offset (integer)
+
+   whence
+          [in] update mode (state)
+
+Remarks
+
+   MPI_FILE_SEEK_SHARED updates the shared file pointer according to
+   whence, which has the following possible values:
+     * MPI_SEEK_SET: the pointer is set to offset
+     * MPI_SEEK_CUR: the pointer is set to the current pointer position
+       plus offset
+     * MPI_SEEK_END: the pointer is set to the end of file plus offset
+
+   MPI_FILE_SEEK_SHARED is collective; all the processes in the
+   communicator group associated with the file handle mpi_fh must call
+   MPI_FILE_SEEK_SHARED with the same values for offset and whence.
+
+   The offset can be negative, which allows seeking backwards. It is
+   erroneous to seek to a negative position in the view.
