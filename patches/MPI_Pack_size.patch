+MPI_Pack_size
+
+   Returns the upper bound on the amount of space needed to pack a message
+int MPI_Pack_size(
+  int incount,
+  MPI_Datatype datatype,
+  MPI_Comm comm,
+  int *size
+);
+
+Parameters
+
+   incount
+          [in] count argument to packing call (integer)
+
+   datatype
+          [in] datatype argument to packing call (handle)
+
+   comm
+          [in] communicator argument to packing call (handle)
+
+   size
+          [out] upper bound on size of packed message, in bytes (integer)
+
+Remarks
+
+   The MPI standard document describes this in terms of MPI_Pack, but it
+   applies to both MPI_Pack and MPI_Unpack. That is, the value size is the
+   maximum that is needed by either MPI_Pack or MPI_Unpack.
+
+   Rationale.
+
+   The call returns an upper bound, rather than an exact bound, since the
+   exact amount of space needed to pack the message may depend on the
+   context (e.g., first message packed in a packing unit may take more
+   space).
+
+Thread and Interrupt Safety
+
+   This routine is thread-safe. This means that this routine may be safely
+   used by multiple threads without the need for any user-provided thread
+   locks. However, the routine is not interrupt safe. Typically, this is
+   due to the use of memory allocation routines such as malloc or other
+   non-MPICH runtime routines that are themselves not interrupt-safe.
+
+Notes for Fortran
+
+   All MPI routines in Fortran (except for MPI_WTIME and MPI_WTICK) have
+   an additional argument ierr at the end of the argument list. ierr is an
+   integer and has the same meaning as the return value of the routine in
+   C. In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are invoked with the
+   call statement.
+
+   All MPI objects (e.g., MPI_Datatype, MPI_Comm) are of type INTEGER in
+   Fortran.
+
+Errors
+
+   All MPI routines (except MPI_Wtime and MPI_Wtick) return an error
+   value; C routines as the value of the function and Fortran routines in
+   the last argument. Before the value is returned, the current MPI error
+   handler is called. By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job.
+   The error handler may be changed with MPI_Comm_set_errhandler (for
+   communicators), MPI_File_set_errhandler (for files), and
+   MPI_Win_set_errhandler (for RMA windows). The MPI-1 routine
+   MPI_Errhandler_set may be used but its use is deprecated. The
+   predefined error handler MPI_ERRORS_RETURN may be used to cause error
+   values to be returned. Note that MPI does not guarentee that an MPI
+   program can continue past an error; however, MPI implementations will
+   attempt to continue whenever possible.
+
+   MPI_SUCCESS
+          No error; MPI routine completed successfully.
+
+   MPI_ERR_COMM
+          Invalid communicator. A common error is to use a null
+          communicator in a call (not even allowed in MPI_Comm_rank).
+
+   MPI_ERR_TYPE
+          Invalid datatype argument. May be an uncommitted MPI_Datatype
+          (see MPI_Type_commit).
+
+   MPI_ERR_ARG
+          Invalid argument. Some argument is invalid and is not identified
+          by a specific error class (e.g., MPI_ERR_RANK).
