+MPI_Request_get_status
+
+   Nondestructive test for the completion of a Request
+int MPI_Request_get_status(
+  MPI_Request request,
+  int *flag,
+  MPI_Status *status
+);
+
+Parameters
+
+   request
+          [in] request (handle)
+
+   flag
+          [out] true if operation has completed (logical)
+
+   status
+          [out] status object (Status). May be MPI_STATUS_IGNORE.
+
+Remarks
+
+   This call is useful for accessing the information associated with a
+   request, without freeing the request (in case the user is expected to
+   access it later). It allows one to layer libraries more conveniently,
+   since multiple layers of software may access the same completed request
+   and extract from it the status information.
+
+   Sets flag=true if the operation is complete, and, if so, returns in
+   status the request status. It sets flag=false if the operation is not
+   complete.
+
+   Unlike MPI_Test, MPI_Request_get_status does not deallocate or
+   deactivate the request. A call to one of the test/wait routines or
+   MPI_Request_free should be made to release the request object.
+
+Thread and Interrupt Safety
+
+   This routine is thread-safe. This means that this routine may be safely
+   used by multiple threads without the need for any user-provided thread
+   locks. However, the routine is not interrupt safe. Typically, this is
+   due to the use of memory allocation routines such as malloc or other
+   non-MPICH runtime routines that are themselves not interrupt-safe.
+
+Notes for Fortran
+
+   All MPI routines in Fortran (except for MPI_WTIME and MPI_WTICK) have
+   an additional argument ierr at the end of the argument list. ierr is an
+   integer and has the same meaning as the return value of the routine in
+   C. In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are invoked with the
+   call statement.
+
+   All MPI objects (e.g., MPI_Datatype, MPI_Comm) are of type INTEGER in
+   Fortran.
+
+Errors
+
+   All MPI routines (except MPI_Wtime and MPI_Wtick) return an error
+   value; C routines as the value of the function and Fortran routines in
+   the last argument. Before the value is returned, the current MPI error
+   handler is called. By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job.
+   The error handler may be changed with MPI_Comm_set_errhandler (for
+   communicators), MPI_File_set_errhandler (for files), and
+   MPI_Win_set_errhandler (for RMA windows). The MPI-1 routine
+   MPI_Errhandler_set may be used but its use is deprecated. The
+   predefined error handler MPI_ERRORS_RETURN may be used to cause error
+   values to be returned. Note that MPI does not guarentee that an MPI
+   program can continue past an error; however, MPI implementations will
+   attempt to continue whenever possible.
+
+   MPI_SUCCESS
+          No error; MPI routine completed successfully.
