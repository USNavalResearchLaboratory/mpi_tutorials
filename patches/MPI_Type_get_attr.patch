+MPI_Type_get_attr
+
+   Retrieves attribute value by key
+int MPI_Type_get_attr(
+  MPI_Datatype type,
+  int type_keyval,
+  void *attribute_val,
+  int *flag
+);
+
+Parameters
+
+   type
+          [in] datatype to which the attribute is attached (handle)
+
+   type_keyval
+          [in] key value (integer)
+
+   attribute_val
+          [out] attribute value, unless flag = false
+
+   flag
+          [out] false if no attribute is associated with the key (logical)
+
+Remarks
+
+   Attributes must be extracted from the same language as they were
+   inserted in with MPI_Type_set_attr. The notes for C and Fortran below
+   explain why.
+
+Notes for C
+
+   Even though the attr_value arguement is declared as void *, it is
+   really the address of a void pointer. See the rationale in the standard
+   for more details.
+
+Thread and Interrupt Safety
+
+   This routine is thread-safe. This means that this routine may be safely
+   used by multiple threads without the need for any user-provided thread
+   locks. However, the routine is not interrupt safe. Typically, this is
+   due to the use of memory allocation routines such as malloc or other
+   non-MPICH runtime routines that are themselves not interrupt-safe.
+
+Notes for Fortran
+
+   All MPI routines in Fortran (except for MPI_WTIME and MPI_WTICK) have
+   an additional argument ierr at the end of the argument list. ierr is an
+   integer and has the same meaning as the return value of the routine in
+   C. In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are invoked with the
+   call statement.
+
+   All MPI objects (e.g., MPI_Datatype, MPI_Comm) are of type INTEGER in
+   Fortran.
+
+Errors
+
+   All MPI routines (except MPI_Wtime and MPI_Wtick) return an error
+   value; C routines as the value of the function and Fortran routines in
+   the last argument. Before the value is returned, the current MPI error
+   handler is called. By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job.
+   The error handler may be changed with MPI_Comm_set_errhandler (for
+   communicators), MPI_File_set_errhandler (for files), and
+   MPI_Win_set_errhandler (for RMA windows). The MPI-1 routine
+   MPI_Errhandler_set may be used but its use is deprecated. The
+   predefined error handler MPI_ERRORS_RETURN may be used to cause error
+   values to be returned. Note that MPI does not guarentee that an MPI
+   program can continue past an error; however, MPI implementations will
+   attempt to continue whenever possible.
+
+   MPI_SUCCESS
+          No error; MPI routine completed successfully.
+
+   MPI_ERR_KEYVAL
+          Invalid keyval
+
+   MPI_ERR_ARG
+          Invalid argument. Some argument is invalid and is not identified
+          by a specific error class (e.g., MPI_ERR_RANK).
