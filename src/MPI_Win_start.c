/* 
MPI_Win_start

   Start an RMA access epoch for MPI
int MPI_Win_start(
  MPI_Group group,
  int assert,
  MPI_Win win
);

Parameters

   group
          [in] group of target processes (handle)

   assert
          [in] Used to optimize this call; zero may be used as a default.
          See notes. (integer)

   win
          [in] window object (handle)

Remarks

   Starts an RMA access epoch for win. RMA calls issued on win during this
   epoch must access only windows at processes in group. Each process in
   group must issue a matching call to MPI_WIN_POST. RMA accesses to each
   target window will be delayed, if necessary, until the target process
   executed the matching call to MPI_WIN_POST. MPI_WIN_START is allowed to
   block until the corresponding MPI_WIN_POST calls are executed, but is
   not required to.

   The assert argument is used to indicate special conditions for the
   fence that an implementation may use to optimize the MPI_Win_start
   operation. The value zero is always correct. Other assertion values may
   be or'ed together. Assertions tha are valid for MPI_Win_start are:

   MPI_MODE_NOCHECK
          the matching calls to MPI_WIN_POST have already completed on all
          target processes when the call to MPI_WIN_START is made. The
          nocheck option can be specified in a start call if and only if
          it is specified in each matching post call. This is similar to
          the optimization of ready-send that may save a handshake when
          the handshake is implicit in the code. (However, ready-send is
          matched by a regular receive, whereas both start and post must
          specify the nocheck option.)

Thread and Interrupt Safety

   This routine is thread-safe. This means that this routine may be safely
   used by multiple threads without the need for any user-provided thread
   locks. However, the routine is not interrupt safe. Typically, this is
   due to the use of memory allocation routines such as malloc or other
   non-MPICH runtime routines that are themselves not interrupt-safe.

Notes for Fortran

   All MPI routines in Fortran (except for MPI_WTIME and MPI_WTICK) have
   an additional argument ierr at the end of the argument list. ierr is an
   integer and has the same meaning as the return value of the routine in
   C. In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are invoked with the
   call statement.

   All MPI objects (e.g., MPI_Datatype, MPI_Comm) are of type INTEGER in
   Fortran.

Errors

   All MPI routines (except MPI_Wtime and MPI_Wtick) return an error
   value; C routines as the value of the function and Fortran routines in
   the last argument. Before the value is returned, the current MPI error
   handler is called. By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job.
   The error handler may be changed with MPI_Comm_set_errhandler (for
   communicators), MPI_File_set_errhandler (for files), and
   MPI_Win_set_errhandler (for RMA windows). The MPI-1 routine
   MPI_Errhandler_set may be used but its use is deprecated. The
   predefined error handler MPI_ERRORS_RETURN may be used to cause error
   values to be returned. Note that MPI does not guarentee that an MPI
   program can continue past an error; however, MPI implementations will
   attempt to continue whenever possible.

   MPI_SUCCESS
          No error; MPI routine completed successfully.

   MPI_ERR_WIN
          Invalid MPI window object

   MPI_ERR_OTHER
          Other error; use MPI_Error_string to get more information about
          this error code.
